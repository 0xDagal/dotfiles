# dotfiles

This is basically where I put some off my config files for my workflow

## Installation

I use GNU Stow, you'll surely have to install it, to link my config files so to
use it for exemple `stow vim`

## Vim

I use Vim as my editor for all what I do. If you want to use my Vim make sur to
install [vim-plug]("https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug").
I use [CoC]("https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim") for my auto-completion and
to get correction, with it I use
[coc-marketplace]("https://github.com/fannheyward/coc-marketplace") to search
for my extensions to install it `:CocInstall coc-marketplace`

## Awesome

I use AwesomeWM as my window manager and you can find my widgets at
[streetturtle repo]("https://github.com/streetturtle/awesome-wm-widgets")

## Alacritty

My terminal emulator is [Alacritty]("https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty")
and I use
[base16-alacritty]("https://github.com/aaron-williamson/base16-alacritty")
to get colors I want to use
[Alacritty Colorscheme]("https://github.com/toggle-corp/alacritty-colorscheme")
but I can't get it work for now

## ZSH

Not there but just to say it I use
[Anth0ny29's ZSH-Powerlevel10k-Script][1]
to install and configure my ZSH (not that I'm working on him to use Antigen ;))
