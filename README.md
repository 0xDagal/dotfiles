# dotfiles

This is basically where I put some off my config files for my workflow

## Installation

I use GNU Stow, you'll surely have to install it, to link my config files so to
use it for exemple `stow vim`

## Vim/Neovim

I used VIm as my only editor but now I use it as my `$EDITOR` and I use Neovim
for developpement.

## BSPWM

I use BSPWM as my window manager

## ST

My terminal emulator is [ST](https://st.suckless.org), I used
[st-flexipatch](https://github.com/bakkeby/st-flexipatch) and
[flexipatch-finalizer](https://github.com/bakkeby/flexipatch-finalizer) to
configure it, I might upload my config one day.

## Bash

My shell is bash
